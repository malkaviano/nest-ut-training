## Purpose

  To present a basic view on how to unit test using Nestjs and Jest.

## Introduction

  This project uses all defaults from Nestjs to set up basic unit tests, using Jest.

  A sample TypeOrm repository was introduced to show a mock in action (not my recommended approach).

  The controller unit test is just an example, complex API Controllers benefit more from e2e tests, but this is out of the scope of this example.

  Unit tests are as simple as they can be, this is on purpose.

## How to run

  - npm i

  - npm test
